# Overview
This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of HypOp framework, as described in Nature Machine Intelligence paper [Distributed Constrained Combinatorial Optimization leveraging Hypergraph Neural Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00833-7). HypOp is a combinatorial optimization solver designed to efficiently address general problems with higher-order constraints. It leverages hypergraph neural networks to extend previous algorithms, enabling them to handle arbitrary cost functions. Additionally, it incorporates a distributed training architecture to efficiently manage large-scale tasks.

# Experimental Setup
Our experiment were conducted on an Intel Xeon 8358P CPU with a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU or multiple GPUs, depending on the task.

---
# System Requirements
The source codes were developed in python 3.9 using Pytorch 2.3.1. The required python dependencies are given in `dependency.txt` file and have been tested on CentOS-7 with CUDA version 11.8.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n new_env_name
conda activate new_env_name
```

# Quick Start
### Hypergraph MaxCut on CPU

```bash
python run run.py
```
### Distributed Hypergraph MaxCut on MULTI-GPUs
This section requires at least two GPUs on your system. We use the NCCL backend for distributed training. You can install NCCL by following the instructions below:

```python
python run_dist.py --test_mode dist --dataset stanford --config configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist_2U.json
```

# Reusability Experiments
Our experiments comprise three components. The configuration files for these experiments are detailed below:
### Part1: Reproduction of Reported Results
- **Experiments on CPU**: ( In `run.py`, set the path of config files to accommodate different experiments.)
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task
      - HypOp: `configs/Hypermaxcut_hypop.json`
      - Bipartite: `configs/Hypermaxcut_bipartite.json`
      - Simulated Annealing (SA): `configs/Hypermaxcut_sa.json`
      - ADAM: `configs/Hypermaxcut_adam.json`
      
    - Graph Maximum independent set (MIS) task
      - HypOp: `configs/MIS_hypop.json`
      - PI-GNN: `configs/MIS_pignn.json`
      

- **Experiments on multi-GPUs**: ( Including two steps, use `run_dist.py`)
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task using HypOp in distributed experiments
        ```python
        python run_dist.py --test_mode dist --dataset stanford --config configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist.json
        
        python run_dist.py --test_mode infer --dataset stanford --config configs/infer_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist.json
        ```
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task using HypOp in parallel multi-GPUs experiments
        ```python
        python run_dist.py --test_mode multi_gpu --dataset stanford --config configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_paral.json
        
        python run_dist.py --test_mode infer --dataset stanford --config configs/infer_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_paral.json
        ```
  
### Part2: Robustness Evaluation of HypOp
This section primarily evaluates the robustness of HypOp across various distributed training configurations.
- **Alternate the number of GPUs**
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task using HypOp: Set GPU number `'num_gpus'` in `'configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist.json'` to `1,2,4,8`.

- **Alternate the graph partition strategy**
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task using HypOp: set `'partition_strategy'` in `'configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist.json'` to `'random', 'metis', 'parmetis', 'extrem'`.

- **Alternate fine-tuning algorithms**
    - Hypergraph MaxCut task using HypOp: set `'fine_tuning'` in `'configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist.json'` to `'SA', 'PSO', 'ACO', 'GA'`.
    
- **An example**

    - Here are the commands for 2 GPUs, using a random graph partition strategy, with the fine-tuning method set to Simulated Annealing (SA).

        ```python
        python run_dist.py --test_mode dist --dataset stanford --config configs/dist_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist_2U.json

        python run_dist.py --test_mode infer --dataset stanford --config configs/infer_configs/maxcut_stanford_for_dist_2U.json
        ```
### Part3: Generalizability Evaluation
This part mainly uses HypOp to solve other combinatorial optimization problems.
- **Apply HypOp on Maximum Clique Problem**

    ```bash
    python maxclique_training.py
    ```
- **Apply HypOp on Quadratic Assignment Problem**
    ```bash
    python QAP_training.py
    ```
